# Installation

The easiest way to run Tracardi is to run it as a docker container. If you are looking for other installation types visit: [http://docs.tracardi.com/installation/](http://docs.tracardi.com/installation/)

In order to do that you must have docker installed on your local machine. 
Please refer to docker installation manual to see how to install docker.

## Dependencies

Tracardi need elasticsearch as its backend. Please pull and run elasticsearch single node docker before you start Tracardi. 

You can do it with this command.
```
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.2
```

## Start Tracardi API

Now pull and run Tracardi backend.

```
docker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-laptop-ip>:9200 -e USER_NAME=admin -e PASSWORD=admin tracardi/tracardi-api
```

Tracardi must connect to elastic. To do that you have to set ELASTIC_HOST variable to reference your laptop's IP. 

> "Waiting for application startup" issue
> 
> Notice that when type `http://localhost:9200` as ELASTIC_HOST you try to connect to Elastic on localhost. This means that you're
> connecting to the docker itself as localhost means local in docker. Obviously elastic is not there, so Tracardi will
> never connect that is why you see "Waiting for application startup" information. Pass external ip for elastic. This may be your laptop IP if you are running Tracardi locally, e.g. 192.168.1.143:9200. Please refer to Tracardi documentation for more Troubleshooting information.
