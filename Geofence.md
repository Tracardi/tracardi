#Definition:
The Geo Fence Plugin for Tracardi is a tool that enables geofencing capabilities within the Tracardi automation platform, allowing users to trigger actions based on geographic location.

#Description:
This GitHub repository houses the Geo Fence Plugin tailored for Tracardi, empowering you to harness geofencing for location-based automation and personalized user experiences.

#Inputs and Outputs:
Inputs: Geofence parameters, such as coordinates and radius, define the location to monitor. Triggers are configured to specify actions upon entering or exiting a geofence.
Outputs: When a user's device enters or exits a defined geofence, the plugin can generate customized actions or events, enriching user interactions.

#Configuration:
Configure the plugin with the following settings:
Geofence coordinates (latitude, longitude)
Geofence radius
Trigger events (entry, exit)
Custom actions or workflows to execute upon trigger.


#Resources Required:
Access to a geospatial database or mapping service for accurate location data.
Network connectivity for real-time location updates.
Adequate processing resources for efficient geofence event handling within the Tracardi environment.

#Errors in Plugin:
Potential issues include:
Inaccurate location data leading to incorrect triggers.
Permissions issues related to location access.
Network connectivity problems causing missed geofence events.
Compatibility issues with specific versions of Tracardi or dependencies.
