# Contribution Guidelines  ðŸ™‚

Contributions are always welcome!!! Before that, please take a moment to review these guidelines before getting started:

- When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, slack, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 
- Don't forget to get yourself assigned before starting to work to avoid any clashes and confusion.
- Please read how to set up a development [environment for API](http://docs.tracardi.com/development/python_env/) or [GUI](http://docs.tracardi.com/development/react_env/)


## Pull Request Process
* Install the [dev environment](https://github.com/Tracardi/tracardi/tree/0.8.1-dev#-installation-and-getting-started) and test the PR.
* You may send your pull requests to the `master` branch, where we do development.
* Associate each Pull Request with the required issue number.
* Please provide relevant steps to use your codebase. Adding a few extra lines of comments or commands to run would be helpful for others to follow along.

## Branch Policy
- **master**: If you are making a contribution, make sure to send your pull request to this branch. All development goes into this branch.
- **versioned-branches**(e.g 0.7.2): After significant features and bug fixes are accumulated in the master branch, we will make a release and make a versioned branch for it.

## Contribution Practices
- Please be respectful of others, do not indulge in unacceptable behaviour. Kindly read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Tracardi/tracardi/blob/0.8.1-dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- If a person is working on or has been assigned an issue and you want to work on it, please ask him/her if he/she is working on it.
- We are happy to allow you to work on your issues, but in the event of a long period of inactivity, the issue will be approved by another volunteer.
- If you report a bug, please provide steps to reproduce the bug.
- If you contribute with a plugin, please provide the plugin documentation in `.md` (Markdown) format.
- If there is a UI-related change, it would be great if you could attach a screenshot with the resultant changes, so it is easier to review for the maintainers.
